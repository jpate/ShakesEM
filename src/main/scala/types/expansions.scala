* ShakesEM is a package for running EM for Probabilistic Context Free Grammars,
* implemented in Scala using the Actors library to allow parallel processing
* over multiple machines and multiple cores. This version implements both
* vanilla EM and the modification to EM in Pereira and Schabes (1992) for
* partially bracketed corpora
